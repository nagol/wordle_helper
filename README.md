# Wordle Helper App

Are you a Wordle fan? This app is like the *game genie* for Wordle making it trivial to Wordle puzzles.

The idea for the tool is to leverage a data set containing information about how commonly used various english words are. 
By taking the puzzle output as inputs, we can filter this dictionary for words that meet the required specifications
and sort by how common the word is.

The data used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency)
