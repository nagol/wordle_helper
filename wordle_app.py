# Wordle Helper
*data + python to the rescue!*

Use the sidebar filters to input information about the target word.

Each guess at the target word provides new information about:
+ letters that are contained in the target word [YELLOW and GREEN]
+ letters that are not contained in the target word [GREY]
+ letters in target word whose position are known [GREEN]
+ letters in target word whose position is forbidden in a particular position [YELLOW]

The table below contains words meeting the selected criteria **sorted by how common the word is in common usage**.
You can use your best judgement about what word to actually use as your next guess but generally you will have
very good results just by always choosing the most common word meeting the criteria selected.
